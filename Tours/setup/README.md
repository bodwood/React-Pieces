## React Projects Starter APP

Removing tours:
1. updated tour state is needed and tour state is saved in app.js
   this means we need to place the function for removing individual
   tours within App.js
2. create function that removes single tours in App.js
3. pass function to Tours component so it can then be passed to Tour
   component (parent -> child -> child)
4. call tour removal function from tour component with id parameter
5. success
